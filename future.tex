\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Our first priority is to implement a prototype for the current Frank
design. Having done that, there is much scope for exploring different
implementations of handlers, both for performance and for exploring
new abstractions.
%
We would like to combine effect handlers with richer type systems,
following the work of McBride~\cite{McBride11} and
Brady~\cite{Brady13}.
%
Handlers provide some of the same functionality as modules and type
classes. We would like to formally relate all three abstractions.
%
We are exploring algebraic effects and effect handlers for
idiom~\cite{McbrideP08} and arrow~\cite{Hughes04} computations.
